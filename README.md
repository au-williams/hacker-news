# hacker-news

My live web app using the "Hacker News" API. Built with the React JS library. https://austinwilliams.dev/hacker-news/

# requirements

*Using the Javascript framework of your choice, build an application that has two pages users can navigate to:*
- *“[/search](https://www.austinwilliams.dev/hacker-news/#/search)” lets the user search the [Hacker News Algolia API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) and displays a list of results*
- *“[/history](https://www.austinwilliams.dev/hacker-news/#/history)” shows a list of searches from this session (these don't need to persist through refresh)*

*We're looking to see what you know in Javascript, querying an API, and state management. We're interested in whether you can write clean code and have the ability to learn/understand new technologies. We don't care about design / UI for this project.*
