My short demo using the Hacker News search API built using the React library

# Requirements:

Using the Javascript framework of your choice, build an application that has two pages users can navigate to:
- “/search” lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)
- “/history” shows the users a list of their past searches from this session (these do not need to persist through refresh)
